# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of 1.6 million tweets to classify them as positive or negative. The classification is performed using logistic regression, a popular statistical method for binary classification problems.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 1.6 million tweets. Each tweet is labeled as either positive or negative based on its sentiment. The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information, such as URLs, mentions, and hashtags.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
2. **Tokenization**: Splitting tweets into individual words or tokens.
3. **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "and", "the").
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.

### Feature Extraction

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).

### Model

- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. In this case, the predictor variables are the TF-IDF features extracted from the tweets.

### Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified tweets.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:
